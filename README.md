### Notes

-  The backend of this project was started on 20MAY21 and was editted multiple times.  Then main focus of backend was facilitating the creation of CRUD routes for the three pages (run, hike, scenic) of the On The Run site.  The original author was Will Pratt.  The QA/QC was Ian Rackson and Katherine Gomez.  Both of whom editied this file up to the last minute and make this project an ultimate success.  
-  Besides the CRUD routes, the additional feature of authentication was added.  This was to ensure users could: 1. not have anyone else edit/deface their activity posts.  2. only that authorized user could post under that username.  This was a good exercise in authorizations in React for the team to problem shoot basic issues like tokens and how to logout.
-  The big challenges for the backend came later in the development.  the first challenge was authentication.  Then, when deployment issues arose, Kathrine and Ian were key in editing the code to make sure it was deployable.
-  Going forward, what would be an extremely useful feature would be uploading pictures from a mobile device.  This would be in line with other social media apps on the market. Another feature would be being able to add the route a user travelled much like Strava.
-  As it relates to features, a key user story/how might we is: "AAU, I would like to be able to post one of my favorite runs/hikes/scenic walks."  In this case, How Might Users that are runners/hikers post about their amazing experiences?  It could be Running in a beautiful city like San Francisco, Hiking the hill country of Texas, or their Scenic hike through the New Mexico "the Land of Enchantment".  Users need to primarily be able to upload pictures and claim their run.  Additionally they need to provide details like a title, location, difficulty, and distance.  Potentially, the pictures and location could be used for future monetization.  The pictures can be leveraged by influencers for their sponsors and location data for a range of purposes.  
-  Ultimately, the On The Run app provides a simple way to post a user's run, hike, or scenic walk for all to see with a clean and colorful UI.
-  Once again, without the team of Ian, Katherine, and Will each contributing extremely important input to the backend, this project would not have been as successful as it was.
